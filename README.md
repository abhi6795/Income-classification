# Income-classification
The adult income dataset is taken from UCI machine learning from which we can explore the possibility of predicting income level based on the individualâ€™s personal information and classify them into various categories. The output of this exercise can be useful to keep government records to develop public policies related to taxation, welfare, and social security.
